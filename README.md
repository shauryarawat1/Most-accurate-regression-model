# Most-accurate-regression-model
This repository includes the code files in which 5 regression models are applied to a dataset.
i) Multiple Linear Regression
ii) Polynomial Regression
iii) Support Vector Regression
iv) Decision Tree Regression
v) Random Forest Regression

The dataset represents the energy output which depends on four factors. This energy output PE depends on Ambient Temperature (AT), Exhaust Vacuum V), Ambient Pressure (AP) and Relative Humidity (RH).
This dataset has 9569 observations.

The accuracy of each model is calculated by the R^2 score. The higher the value of R^2 score higher is the accuracy.

After checking the R^2 scores of each model we come to the conclusion that the Random Forest Regression model is the best model that can be used for this dataset.
